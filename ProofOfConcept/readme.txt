Proof of Concept using Excel (Much quicker to do basic analysis in excel than setup a framework for more advanced analysis in python without any evidence this works.)

Ofcourse this technique is widely used, this does not mean it is necessarily viable as a methodology though.

This Excel sheet acts as a very basic proof of possibility of finding patterns which Technical Analysis is based on.

- In the first sheet, AAPL, already some sort of pattern emerges looking at N1:O6, showing that most people bought the stock later in the week than earlier in the week.

-This was not true of MCFT in the second sheet although the pattern still holds for Friday.

This was ther only conclusive finding from this simple Excel analysis

There may be atleast a small possibility then, of genuinely going forward with this.
